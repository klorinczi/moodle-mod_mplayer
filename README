This version is a preliminary publication after formal review.  This is yet a beta version where we tried to rearchitecture
main features. Documentation writing and review is in progress. There are advanced features that are not yet fully tested
such as simple dealing with streamers or pseudo-streaming. A further package may clean the "bad ideas" options when we can
finish the complete qualification.

Our final goal is to provide an economic minimal viable way for small institutions to diffuse a reasonable set of videos with
a very simple as possible, lightweight and costless solution.

How to install the Media Player

PLEASE NOTE: THIS MAY NOT BE THE LATEST VERSION OF THE MODULE. PLEASE FIND THE LATEST VERSION AT:
http://code.google.com/p/moodle-mplayer/downloads/list

The SWF Activity Module is the most flexible, functional, robust and powerful way to deploy Flash animations and applications in Moodle 1.9. It supports any version of Flash and Actionscript.

    Upload the /mplayer/ directory and all its contents to ***YOUR MOODLE***/mod/
    Make sure that the directory structure isn't ***YOUR MOODLE***/mod/mplayer/mplayer/... It should be ***YOUR MOODLE***/mod/mplayer/...
    In Moodle, login as an administrator
    Go to Site Administration > Notifications
    The Media Player will install/update itself
    If any settings have been changed, you'll be asked to save the settings on the Site Administration > Modules > Activities > Media Player page
    That's it!

Do not be to greedy anyway : video and live media are very complex and heavy technologies that fully justify the "cost of service"
of major providers such as Kaltura, Livemedia or other professional providers. This plugin has limited goals and no service garantees
as being free development initiative. It will probably be in "on progress" status driven by our internal needs and challenges.

Design Notes
===============

The .stm format

STM files are manifests that are used as proxy descriptors for remotely dispatched medias. 
the effective media file may be stored into an extra storage out of control of Moodle and
may be delivered from a streamed URL. the manifest file should be usually built by the MPlayer 
module, after a media upload. the manifest file is an XML file with a simple internal schema :

<XML version="1.0">
<Video>
    <Source>
        <streamer>wowza</streamer>
        <streamerurl>rtmp://medias.mysite/com</streamerurl>
        <appication>/vod</application>
        <clip>0</clip>
        <location>mp4:streamedfile.mp4</location>
    </Source>
</Video>
